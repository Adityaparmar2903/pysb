Introduction to modeling
========================

The premise to all modeling is that, given experimental
observations, we have reason to believe that a system is governed by a
set of rules which we aim to understand and employ for furthe
manipulation of the system. As such, models aim both to *explain* the
behavior of a system given a set of conditions, or to predict the
behavior of a system given a set of conditions. The best models can
perform both tasks to explain and predict. 

PySB as modeling tool
=====================
*PySB* is a set of software tools that enables users to develop,
implement, and execute biological models in a programming
environment.


An example
----------

Here we will spin a nice little yarn about an end-to-end use case
showcasing at least the key features of PySB.  It should entice
readers to keep reading to learn more and hopefully become PySB users.
Sort of an elevator pitch.  So it should also be pretty short, but
probably could be longer than the intro above.

Conversion from other modeling tools
------------------------------------

Here we give some pointers for people coming from SBML, BNG/Kappa,
Matlab, etc. in order to start converting their models and scripts to
work with PySB.  Mostly just a list of resources, not full
explanations.  This will help assure users of those tools that they
can relatively easily carry over their current modeling investments.

Prerequisites
-------------

List python versions, python modules and versions, and external tools
needed to get PySB running.  Start with the minimal set, then list the
nice-to-have pieces.

Usage
-----

See :doc:`tutorial` for an introduction.  For a simple test of PySB
and a quick look at what is possible, run xxxx.py in the yyyy
directory.

.. todo:: Create xxxx.py and fix up previous paragraph accordingly.

   Note: these section headings are mostly copied from the docs for
   Sphinx itself.  Seems like a nice breakdown.
